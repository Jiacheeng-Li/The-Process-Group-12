1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Why did no one tell me that New Zealand

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
was gonna be this cold

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I am frozen solid right now

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,500
It was about 5 degrees two days ago

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,000
I was in a bikini, the weather has changed so much

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I knew that the further south

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,500
the colder it was gonna be

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
I didn't know it was gonna be this cold

9
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm at the most beautiful lake

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
we're at Lake Tekapo and


11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I definitely don't have the right clothing for this kind of weather

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,500
I desperately need a pair of gloves because my hands are freezing

13
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,400
Not ready for I came from Sydney summer

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,800
And I' m gonna go back to Sydney summer

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,000
And I'm not ready

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but yeah it's so cold here right now

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,500
the weather has changed, we've had some really gorgeous days

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,000
I mean when the sun's out and it's blue skies

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm happy anyway, I just wish I was more prepared, I'm so cold
