00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:01,900
Welcome to Antipode: DayDreamNight.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,200
This is our Sprint 2 Iteration Overview.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,433
After Sprint 1, we conducted a heuristic evaluation
 to analyse usability issues

4
00:00:09,433 --> 00:00:13,333
Based on these findings, 
we updated our Gantt chart and Kanban board

5
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:16,333
to realign the priorities and workload for Sprint 2 --

6
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:21,000
focusing on page integration, feature updates, 
and unified UI design.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,100
To leverage each member's strengths, 
Ziyi shifted to redesigning the Home page,

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,900
 while Na shifted toward ethics and  testing.

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,300
Now, let's look at the updated Sprint 2 interfaces.

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,600
Our Home page now supports smooth playback, 
reactions, and quick switching.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,200
The Friends page lets users view friends' posts and interact.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,100
The Capture page supports camera switching, 
draft preparation and so on.

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,000
After recording, users can add tags, and save before posting.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,100
The Chat page provides a cleaner layout for messaging, and group conversations.

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:57,066
The Profile page unifies styling and presents replays, 
tagged videos, and activity clearly

16
00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:02,566
We used GitHub with feature branches to manage version control
and coordinate collaborative development.

17
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:08,500
After sprint 2, we exchanged feedback with another international dev group via soffline demo and a short questionnaire. 

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,766
These results highlighted gaps in internationalisation, accessibility, and UI styling.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,400
In Sprint 3, we will focus on improving them and completing e
the remaining core interactions.
