00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:01,900
Welcome to Antipode: DayDreamNight.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,200
This is our Sprint 1 Iteration Overview.

3
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:08,666
Before Sprint 1 began, we established our core use cases and design concept:

4
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:12,633

a global video-sharing app connecting people across day and night.

5
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:16,500
It lets users experience real-time moments from the opposite side of the world.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,266
We planned our development timeline using a Gantt chart,
setting clear weekly milestones.

7
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:24,766
We also defined team roles and adopted a Kanban workflow.

8
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:27,833
All project documentation was recorded by Xintong.

9
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:34,533
To shape the structure and visual direction of the app,
Jiacheng created the initial UI wireframes and prototypes.

10
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:38,900
In Sprint 1, our primary goal was to build the fundamental page frameworks.

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,666
Home Page and Video Player — implemented by Caona,
including the base playback scaffolding.

12
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:48,200
Capture Page framework — built by Yuanxi, 
featuring a front–rear camera switch

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,433
and a post-recording flow for adding text, 
tags, and basic edits.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,400
Chat and Profile Pages — developed by Ziyi,
forming the foundation of the social interface,

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,800
including the basic messaging layout 
and user info display.

16
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:06,633
We used GitHub with feature branches to manage version control
and coordinate collaborative development.

17
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:11,500
Sprint 1 delivered our core structural frameworks, 
but we also identified gaps

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,900
pages remain unintegrated, styling is minimal, 
and key functions are still incomplete.

19
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,900
These findings shape our priorities for Sprint 2.
