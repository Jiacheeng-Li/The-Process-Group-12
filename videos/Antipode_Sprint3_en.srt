Welcome to Antipode: DayDreamNight.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,266
This is our Sprint 3 Iteration Overview.

3
00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:07,966
After last week's cross-team evaluation, 
we focused on three priorities: 

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:12,266
accessibility, internationalisation, and overall UI refinement,

5
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:14,400
and updated our Kanban accordingly.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,533
From the Settings panel on the Home page, users can now access our new Accessibility & Internationalisation centre.

7
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:24,566
Screen narration provides spoken feedback for on-screen content.

8
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:28,333
Subtitles display synchronized text for all audio elements.

9
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,900
High-contrast mode enhances visual clarity with a sharper color scheme.

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,966
Users can also fine-tune brightness, contrast, saturation, and playback speed through adjustable parameters.

11
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:44,133
We also added keyboard support, with Arrow keys for playback control and Control-Arrow keys for quick video actions.

12
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:50,733
The interface language can now be switched between English and Chinese, and video subtitles support multiple languages.

13
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:56,000
And all five pages were refined visually for consistency, 
especially the Friends page.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,600
We still used GitHub to manage version control
and coordinate collaborative development.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,066
At the end of Sprint 3, we conducted a Cognitive Walkthrough and follow-up interviews to evaluate the updated prototype.

16
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:13,066
The feedback showed that, despite a few remaining refinements, the core experience is solid and ready for presentation. 

17
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:17,166
This concludes Sprint 3 and finalises our deliverable prototype.

18
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,400
Thank you for watching.
